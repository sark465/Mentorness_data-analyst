The file1 of this internship project  is designed to test  SQL and data analysis skills in a real-world context. I am
encouraged to be creative in your approach and to seek guidance and assistance as needed throughout
the internship. 


The file2 of this internship project aims to analyse a dataset of hotel aggregator listings using SQL. The dataset
comprises various attributes related to listings, hosts, reviews, and availability. The objective is to create
comprehensive visualizations and insights that shed light on trends, patterns, and factors influencing the
performance of listings. Through SQL, interns will explore key metrics such as pricing, availability,
host characteristics, and review scores to derive actionable insights for improving the overall quality and
competitiveness of the listings.
